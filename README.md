# Supermarket Data Analysis

Welcome to the Supermarket Data Analysis project repository! This project focuses on analyzing a supermarket dataset to extract actionable insights, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement.

## Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive analysis of the supermarket data using Jupyter Notebook. The primary techniques employed include:

### Clustering
Application of clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.

### Classification
Implementation of classification algorithms to predict customer churn, facilitating the development of proactive retention strategies and improving customer loyalty.

### Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)
Utilization of Time Series ARIMA models to forecast sales and identify seasonal trends, offering insights for optimizing inventory management and resource allocation.
